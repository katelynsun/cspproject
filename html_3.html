                      <time class="subtitle">The Beatles were an English rock band consisting of four teenagers 
                        from Liverpool. The group performed at small venues in 1960 and 1961. When Brian Epstein
                        saw the group play at the Cavern Club, he was curious after hearing mention of the band. 
                        He returned to take in a few more shows and on December 10, 1961, Epstein approached
                        the band and a five-year contract was signed in January of 1962. The Beatles' first single,
                        "Please Please Me," was recorded in November and released in January 1963. The song reached 
                        No. 1 in the UK.<time>

                      <time class="subtitle">Ludwig van Beethoven was a German painist and composer. His compositions 
                        were a combination of vocals and instruments. Beethoven life was marked by a struggle against 
                        deafness. As a child, Beethoven's father began teaching him music with an extraordinary rigor 
                        and brutality that affected Beethoven for the rest of his life. When the Holy Roman Emperor died 
                        in 1790, Beethoven received the honor of composing a musical memorial. He made his long-awaited 
                        public debut in Vienna on March 29, 1795. Beethoven's most famous piece is FÃ¼r Elise.<time>

                      <time class="subtitle">Miles Davis was born in 1926, in Alton, Illinois. His dad introduced him to a trumpet at age 13. Davis developed a talent to play 
                        the trumpet and emplasized playing it without vibrato. While in high school, he played professionally and was invited to play with Dizzy Gillespie and Charles
                        Parker. In 1945, Davis dropped out of Juilliard and become a full-time jazz musician, recording his first song as band
                        leader. In the '50s and '70s, Davis was drawn into drug abuse. He overcame the addiction
                        and spent the '80s experimenting different styles. He died of 
                        pneumonia and respiratory failure in 1991. His recording with Jones brought him his final Grammy in 1993. The honor 
                        was just another testament to Davis' lasting influence on jazz.<time>
